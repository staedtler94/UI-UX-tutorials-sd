UI and UX project
===================

A project to showcase the various UI components for the web and strategies to improve user experience and the customer journey.

Although UI and UX are quite different topics, without a well planned user interface the user experience falls short. 

The reason why I am exploring this project is because as a developer I had little knowledge of User Experience and what the business and design team has to go through in delivering a good user experience. 

With this project I plan to help developers gain some insights which I hope can help them design and develop top quality UX.
